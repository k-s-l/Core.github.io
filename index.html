                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge.If you can’t do it alone, remember that asking for help is part of doing the work.Education requires costly resources, like time and money, which are often hard to find. But those who do invest these resources, often end up richer – not just because they often improve their financial situation, but because their minds are richer too.Education connects you with the stories, theories and accomplishments of faraway cultures and generations. It offers you a body of knowledge greater than you can ever gain on your own in one lifetime.When you develop critical thinking, you no longer take things for granted. </p>
